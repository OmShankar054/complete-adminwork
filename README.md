Challenges and Solutions 
When developing web application with Ejs (Embedded JavaScript) and Node.js, several challenges and solution typically arise.
One significant challenge is managing the complexity of rendering dynamic content seamlessly. 
Developing a report web application using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) and Node.js presents several challenges. 
One primary challenge is managing dynamic data rendering efficiently. As reports often involve large datasets, ensuring that data is fetched and displayed promptly can be complex. 
Handling asynchronous operations, such as database queries, and integrating them seamlessly with EJS templates can lead to performance bottlenecks if not managed properly.
Another challenge is maintaining a clean and organized codebase, especially when dealing with complex report structures. 
Ensuring that the EJS templates remain modular and reusable while managing the business logic in Node.js requires careful planning and adherence to coding best practices. 
Additionally, securing the application is crucial, as reports may contain sensitive information.
Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, as well as protecting against common web vulnerabilities, adds another layer of complexity.

Learning Outcomes 
1. Understanding Dynamic Data Rendering:
   - Develop the ability to manage and optimize the rendering of dynamic data using EJS and Node.js.
   - Learn to implement efficient data fetching strategies, such as caching and pagination, to handle large datasets effectively.

2. Asynchronous Programming in Node.js:
   - Gain proficiency in using asynchronous functions and promises to ensure seamless integration of data fetching and template rendering.
   - Understand how to avoid performance bottlenecks and ensure smooth application operation.

3. Maintaining Clean and Organized Codebases:
   - Learn to adopt the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve code maintainability.
   - Gain skills in using partials and components in EJS to promote code reusability and modularity.

4. Security Best Practices:
   - Develop knowledge of implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JWT and role-based access control, to secure sensitive information.
   - Understand and apply security best practices, including input validation, sanitization, and the use of secure HTTP headers, to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Learn to identify and address performance bottlenecks in web applications.
   - Gain skills in optimizing the performance of Node.js applications and EJS templates.

Conclusion
Developing a report web application using EJS and Node.js involves overcoming several challenges, such as efficiently managing dynamic data rendering, maintaining a clean and organized codebase, 
and ensuring robust security measures. Addressing these challenges requires a solid understanding of asynchronous programming, effective use of caching mechanisms, 
and the adoption of best practices in code modularity and security.
Overall, the learning outcomes from tackling these challenges provide a strong foundation for developing sophisticated web applications using EJS and Node.js. 
These skills are essential for building scalable, maintainable, and secure web applications that meet the demands of modern users and businesses.

FUTURE SCOPE OF WORK
Web Development or Web Designing is a short-term professional job-oriented course.
There are huge opportunities available for the students who want to work in this field. 
Many private and public organizations hire web designer for their online work and website development
professionals is increasing and this has created a huge job opportunity for the aspirants in the upcoming days.
